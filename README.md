# AutoBadger

Picture this: your workplace has given you a Work Laptop™, with all 
the bells and whistles. But since your company is a Very Secure Company™,
they require you to swipe your badge on a USB sensor to log in, like these:

Familiar scenario? Tired of having to reach out for your badge and
swiping it manually?

**Behold: the solution!** 

Grab an Arduino, a servo, a (possibly big and red) button
and get yourself an AutoBadger! Open source, zero maintenance, 
gluten free, and ambient friendly!
